# Develpment techonogies with Java

I must admit, the naming of this course is poor, and to be honnest, the course is kind of all over the place, but it was nice for a change. The idea is that we where learning Java as a language by using it together with other development tools, like for example Docker, Kafka.. or some other concepts like JWT Tokens and microservices. 

Honnestly, I'm glad I took the course, even though I'm not exactly a fan of the language.
